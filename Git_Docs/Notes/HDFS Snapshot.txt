We can Protect  Enterprise data in HDFS with HDFS Snapshots.

HDFS Snapshots are read-only point-in-time copies of the file system. Snapshots can be taken on a subtree of the file system or the entire file system. Some common use cases of snapshots are data backup, protection against user errors.

•	Snapshot creation is instantaneous
•	Snapshots do not adversely affect regular HDFS operations
•	Blocks in datanodes are not copied: the snapshot files record the block list and the file size. There is no data copying .

If you need to check, please try these commands only in your Local VM.

Make Your HDFS Directory Snapshotable:
sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfsadmin -allowSnapshot  <HDFS Directory>


TAKE POINT IN TIME SNAPSHOTS OF HDFS Directory:
sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -createSnapshot <HDFS Directory>

Delete any file in the directory who’s snapshot is taken in second step.

COPY THE FILE FROM SNAPSHPOT TO THE ACTUAL DIRECTORY.
sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -cp <Location_Of_File_In_Shnapshotfile> <Original_Location_Of_File>
